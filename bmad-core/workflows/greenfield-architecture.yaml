  description: >-
    Agent workflow for designing the architecture of a new application, from enterprise alignment to detailed system design.
  type: greenfield
  project_types:
    - enterprise-app
    - saas
    - platform-component

  sequence:
    - agent: domain-architect
      action: analyze-current-state
      notes: "Analyzes the current enterprise landscape to understand the context for the new application."

    - agent: domain-architect
      creates: domain-architecture.md
      uses: create-domain-architecture
      notes: "Defines the new application's role and boundaries within the enterprise domain. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final domain-architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: domain-architect
      action: analyze-solution-principles
      requires: domain-architecture.md
      notes: "Ensures the proposed domain architecture aligns with established enterprise principles."

    - agent: architect
      creates: fullstack-architecture.md
      uses: create-full-stack-architecture
      requires: domain-architecture.md
      notes: "Creates the detailed system-level architecture for the new application. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final fullstack-architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: security
      action: conduct-threat-model
      requires: fullstack-architecture.md
      notes: "Performs a threat modeling exercise on the proposed system architecture."

    - agent: architect
      updates: fullstack-architecture.md
      requires: threat-model.md
      condition: threat_model_suggests_changes
      notes: "Updates the architecture to mitigate any threats identified."

    - agent: po
      validates: all_artifacts
      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all architecture documents for consistency and completeness."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents
      condition: po_checklist_issues
      notes: "If PO finds issues, return to the relevant architect to fix and re-export updated documents."

    - workflow_end:
      action: architecture_complete
      notes: "All architecture planning artifacts are complete and validated. The project can now move to PRD and story creation."
