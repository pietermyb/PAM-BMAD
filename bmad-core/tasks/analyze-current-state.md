# Analyze Current State

## Purpose
Analyze and document the current state of the enterprise architecture, systems, and business capabilities to establish a baseline for transformation planning.

## Context
This task is essential for understanding the existing landscape before planning any architectural changes or transformations. It provides the foundation for gap analysis and target state planning.

## Workflow

### 1. Enterprise Context Analysis
- **Business Strategy Review**
  - Current business objectives and goals
  - Market position and competitive landscape
  - Strategic initiatives and priorities
  - Key performance indicators and metrics

- **Organizational Structure**
  - Business units and their relationships
  - Governance models and decision-making processes
  - Key stakeholders and their roles
  - Organizational culture and change readiness

### 2. Current State Architecture Assessment
- **Business Architecture**
  - Current business capabilities and maturity levels
  - Business processes and workflows
  - Information flows and data ownership
  - Business locations and distribution

- **Application Architecture**
  - Application portfolio and landscape
  - System dependencies and integration points
  - Technology stack and platforms
  - Application health and technical debt

- **Data Architecture**
  - Data models and structures
  - Data stores and repositories
  - Data quality and governance
  - Data integration and flows

- **Technology Architecture**
  - Infrastructure and platforms
  - Network and security architecture
  - Development and deployment processes
  - Technology standards and policies

### 3. Capability Assessment
- **Business Capabilities**
  - Core business capabilities
  - Supporting capabilities
  - Enabling capabilities
  - Capability maturity assessment

- **Technology Capabilities**
  - Development capabilities
  - Integration capabilities
  - Security capabilities
  - Operational capabilities

### 4. Pain Points and Challenges
- **Business Challenges**
  - Process inefficiencies
  - Customer experience issues
  - Compliance and regulatory challenges
  - Cost and performance issues

- **Technical Challenges**
  - System limitations and constraints
  - Integration complexity
  - Technical debt and legacy systems
  - Scalability and performance issues

### 5. Stakeholder Analysis

  - Business stakeholders
  - Technical stakeholders
  - External stakeholders
  - Influencers and decision makers

- **Stakeholder Engagement**
  - Interviews and workshops
  - Surveys and assessments
  - Document reviews
  - Observation and shadowing

### 6. Documentation and Artifacts
- **Current State Documentation**
  - Architecture diagrams and models
  - Process maps and workflows
  - System inventories and catalogs
  - Data models and flows

- **Assessment Reports**
  - Capability maturity assessments
  - Technology health checks
  - Risk assessments
  - Gap identification

## Outputs
1. **Current State Architecture Document** - Comprehensive documentation of existing architecture
2. **Capability Assessment Report** - Detailed analysis of business and technology capabilities
3. **Pain Points Analysis** - Identification of key challenges and issues
4. **Stakeholder Analysis** - Understanding of key stakeholders and their needs
5. **Current State Diagrams** - Visual representation of existing architecture

## Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of current enterprise landscape
- Clear identification of pain points and challenges
- Comprehensive stakeholder engagement
- Accurate baseline for transformation planning
- Alignment with business strategy and objectives

## Dependencies
