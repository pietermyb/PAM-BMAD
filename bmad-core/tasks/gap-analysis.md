# Gap Analysis

## Purpose
Identify and analyze the gaps between current state and target state architecture to determine the scope and complexity of transformation initiatives and prioritize improvement opportunities.

## Context
This task bridges the current state analysis and target state definition to provide actionable insights for transformation planning. It helps prioritize initiatives and allocate resources effectively.
