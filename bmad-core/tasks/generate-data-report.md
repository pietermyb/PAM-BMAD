# generate-data-report

This task outlines the steps for generating a data report based on specified requirements.

## 1. Understand Reporting Requirements

- Clarify the purpose and audience of the report.
- Identify key metrics, dimensions, and filters required.
- Determine the desired output format (e.g., tabular, charts, dashboards, PDF, CSV).
- Define the frequency and delivery method of the report.

## 2. Identify Data Sources

- Pinpoint the databases, tables, or external systems containing the necessary data.
- Understand the data schema and relationships.

## 3. Data Extraction

- Write SQL queries or use data extraction tools to retrieve raw data.
- Ensure data extraction is efficient and minimizes impact on source systems.

## 4. Data Transformation and Preparation

- Cleanse data (handle missing values, inconsistencies, duplicates).
- Transform data into the required format for reporting (e.g., aggregations, calculations, joins).
- Create derived metrics or features if necessary.

## 5. Report Generation

- Use reporting tools (e.g., SQL Reporting Services, Tableau, Power BI, Python scripts with libraries like Pandas/Matplotlib) to build the report.
- Design visualizations (charts, graphs) that effectively convey insights.
- Ensure the report is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- Add titles, labels, legends, and any necessary explanatory text.

## 6. Validation and Review

- Verify the accuracy of the data and calculations in the report.
- Cross-check with source systems or known good data.
- Review the report with stakeholders to ensure it meets their requirements.

## 7. Distribution and Automation

- Distribute the report to the intended audience.
- Automate the report generation and distribution process if it's a recurring report.
- Set up monitoring for automated reports to ensure successful execution.

## 8. Documentation

- Document the report's purpose, data sources, logic, and distribution method.
- Maintain version control for report definitions and scripts.
