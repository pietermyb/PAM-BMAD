# deploy-application

## Purpose
This task outlines the comprehensive steps required to safely and efficiently deploy an application to a designated target environment, ensuring all pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment activities are meticulously executed.

## Workflow

### 1. Pre-deployment Checks
Before initiating any deployment, a series of critical checks must be performed to ensure readiness and minimize risks. This involves verifying the integrity of the build artifacts, confirming the health and accessibility of the target environment, and ensuring all necessary configurations are in place.

- **Artifact Verification**: Confirm that all required build artifacts are available, correctly versioned, and free from corruption. This includes application binaries, Docker images, configuration files, and any other deployable components.
- **Environment Readiness**: Verify the health, accessibility, and capacity of the target deployment environment. This includes checking network connectivity, available resources (CPU, memory, storage), and necessary permissions.
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure all environment-specific configurations, such as environment variables, secrets, database connection strings, and API keys, are correctly set up and accessible to the deployment process.
- **Plan Review**: Thoroughly review the deployment plan, including the sequence of operations, dependencies, and the defined rollback strategy. All stakeholders should be aware of the plan and any potential impact.

### 2. Prepare Environment
This phase involves preparing the target environment for the new application deployment, which may include provisioning new infrastructure or updating existing components.

- **Infrastructure Provisioning/Update**: If required, provision new infrastructure or update existing infrastructure components using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation). This ensures consistency and repeatability.
- **Network Configuration**: Configure network access controls, security groups, and firewall rules to allow necessary inbound and outbound traffic for the application and its dependencies.
- **Database Preparation**: Execute any necessary database migrations or schema updates. This should be done carefully, with proper backups and a clear rollback plan for database changes.

### 3. Deploy Application
This is the core deployment phase where the application artifacts are transferred and activated in the target environment.

- **Instance Management**: If applicable, gracefully stop existing application instances to prepare for the new deployment. This may involve draining connections or redirecting traffic.
- **Artifact Deployment**: Deploy the new application artifacts to the target environment. This could involve pulling Docker images, copying code bundles, or deploying serverless functions.
- **Database Updates**: Apply any pending database migrations or schema changes that were prepared in the previous step.
- **Configuration Application**: Update application configuration files or environment variables to point to the newly deployed artifacts or to reflect any environment-specific settings.
- **Instance Activation**: Start the new application instances. This may involve bringing up new containers, virtual machines, or serverless functions.

### 4. Post-deployment Verification
After the application is deployed, a series of verification steps are crucial to confirm successful deployment and proper functionality.

- **Health and Status Checks**: Verify the overall health and status of the deployed application. This includes checking service endpoints, application logs for startup messages, and internal health checks.
- **Smoke Tests**: Execute a set of basic functional tests (smoke tests) to ensure critical application functionalities are working as expected in the deployed environment.
- **Log Review**: Thoroughly review application logs and server logs for any errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior that might indicate issues with the deployment.
- **Dependency Connectivity**: Confirm that the deployed application can successfully connect to and interact with all its dependent services, such as databases, message queues, and external APIs.

### 5. Monitoring and Rollback Preparedness
This final stage ensures that the deployed application is continuously monitored and that a robust rollback mechanism is in place for unforeseen issues.

- **Monitoring Activation**: Verify that all relevant monitoring and alerting systems are active and collecting data for the newly deployed application. This includes metrics, logs, and traces.
- **Rollback Confirmation**: Reconfirm that the rollback procedures are clearly documented, understood by the team, and can be executed swiftly if a critical issue arises post-deployment.
- **Metrics and Logs Capture**: Ensure that all deployment-related metrics and logs are captured and stored for future analysis, auditing, and post-mortem reviews.

## Outputs
- Deployed application instances in the target environment.
- Updated database schema (if applicable).
- Deployment logs and metrics.
- Verification test results.

## Success Criteria
- Application successfully deployed and accessible in the target environment.
- All critical functionalities are working as expected.
- No new errors or performance degradations introduced.
- Monitoring and alerting systems are fully operational for the deployed application.
- Rollback procedure is confirmed to be viable.

## Dependencies
- Verified build artifacts.
- Accessible and properly configured target environment.
- Defined deployment plan and rollback strategy.
- Necessary credentials and permissions for deployment.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Deployment failure due to incorrect configurations.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement automated configuration validation and use environment-specific configuration management tools.
- **Risk**: Application downtime during deployment.
  - **Mitigation**: Utilize blue/green deployments, canary releases, or rolling updates to minimize downtime.
- **Risk**: Introduction of new bugs or performance issues.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive automated testing (unit, integration, performance, smoke) and thorough post-deployment verification.
- **Risk**: Database corruption or data loss during migrations.
  - **Mitigation**: Perform database backups before migrations, use idempotent migration scripts, and test migrations in non-production environments.
