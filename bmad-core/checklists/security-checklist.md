# Security Best Practices

## General

- [ ] **Principle of Least Privilege**: Do all users and components have the minimum necessary privileges?
- [ ] **Security Awareness Training**: Are employees trained to recognize and respond to security threats?
- [ ] **Incident Response Plan**: Is there a plan in place to respond to security incidents?
- [ ] **Logging and Monitoring**: Is there adequate logging and monitoring to detect security incidents?
- [ ] **Keep Software Updated**: Are all software components, including libraries, frameworks, and servers, regularly updated to patch known vulnerabilities?

## Web

- [ ] **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Is all user input validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks?
- [ ] **Authentication and Session Management**: Are strong authentication mechanisms and secure session management practices in place?
- [ ] **Authorization and Access Control**: Is access control enforced to ensure users can only access authorized data and functionality?
- [ ] **Secure Communication (HTTPS)**: Is all communication encrypted using HTTPS?
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Are appropriate security headers used to protect against common web vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Are third-party dependencies regularly scanned for vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Secure Error Handling and Logging**: Are error messages generic and are security events properly logged?

## Application

- [ ] **Secure Coding Practices**: Is code written with security in mind, avoiding common vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Are application dependencies regularly scanned for vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Security Testing (SAST/DAST)**: Is the application regularly tested for security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Secure Deployment and Operations**: Are secure configurations and secrets management in place?
- [ ] **Threat Modeling**: Has a threat model been created to identify and mitigate potential threats?

## Data

- [ ] **Data Discovery and Classification**: Is all data identified and classified based on sensitivity?
- [ ] **Access Control**: Is access to data restricted based on the principle of least privilege?
- [ ] **Data Encryption**: Is data encrypted at rest and in transit?
- [ ] **Backup and Recovery**: Is data regularly backed up and are recovery procedures tested?
- [ ] **Secure Data Disposal**: Is data securely disposed of when no longer needed?
- [ ] **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Are DLP measures in place to prevent data breaches?

## Infrastructure

- [ ] **Network Security**: Is the network segmented and are firewalls and IDS/IPS in use?
- [ ] **Host and Endpoint Security**: Are servers and endpoints hardened and protected with anti-malware?
- [ ] **Access Control**: Is access to infrastructure resources controlled and monitored?
- [ ] **Logging, Monitoring, and Incident Response**: Is infrastructure activity logged and monitored for security events?
- [ ] **Cloud Security**: Are cloud environments securely configured and monitored?
