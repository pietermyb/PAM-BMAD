# performance-checklist

This checklist provides a guide for Performance Engineers to ensure comprehensive coverage of performance testing and optimization tasks.

## 1. Planning and Strategy

- [ ] Define performance objectives and non-functional requirements (NFRs).
- [ ] Identify key business transactions and user journeys.
- [ ] Determine workload models (e.g., number of users, transaction rates).
- [ ] Select appropriate performance testing tools.
- [ ] Define test environments and data requirements.
- [ ] Establish success criteria and metrics (e.g., response time, throughput, resource utilization).

## 2. Test Scripting and Execution

- [ ] Develop realistic performance test scripts.
- [ ] Parameterize test data to avoid caching issues.
- [ ] Configure test scenarios (e.g., load, stress, endurance, spike).
- [ ] Execute performance tests in a controlled environment.
- [ ] Monitor system resources during test execution.

## 3. Analysis and Reporting

- [ ] Analyze test results against defined success criteria.
- [ ] Identify performance bottlenecks (e.g., database, application code, network, infrastructure).
- [ ] Correlate performance metrics with system logs and traces.
- [ ] Generate comprehensive performance test reports.
- [ ] Present findings and recommendations to stakeholders.

## 4. Optimization and Retesting

- [ ] Propose specific optimizations (e.g., code refactoring, query tuning, infrastructure scaling).
- [ ] Implement recommended changes.
- [ ] Retest to validate improvements and ensure no regressions.
- [ ] Document all optimization efforts and their impact.

## 5. Continuous Performance Monitoring

- [ ] Integrate performance monitoring into CI/CD pipelines.
- [ ] Establish performance baselines for production systems.
- [ ] Configure alerts for performance deviations.
- [ ] Regularly review production performance metrics.
