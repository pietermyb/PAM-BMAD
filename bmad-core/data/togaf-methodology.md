## Architecture Content Framework (ACF)

### ACF Overview
The ACF provides a structured approach to organizing and classifying architectural artifacts, deliverables, and building blocks.

### ACF Structure
- **Deliverables**: Formal documents that are contractually specified
- **Artifacts**: Architectural work products that describe architecture
- **Building Blocks**: Reusable components of business, IT, or architecture capability

### ACF Categories
- **Strategic**: High-level strategic artifacts
- **Segment**: Business unit or domain-specific artifacts
- **Capability**: Capability-focused artifacts
- **Solution**: Solution-specific artifacts

## Enterprise Continuum

### Continuum Overview
The Enterprise Continuum is a repository of architectural assets and solutions that can be reused and adapted.

### Continuum Structure
- **Architecture Continuum**: Repository of reusable architecture building blocks
- **Solutions Continuum**: Repository of reusable solution building blocks

### Continuum Categories
- **Foundation**: Basic building blocks and patterns
- **Common Systems**: Industry-specific building blocks
- **Industry**: Industry-specific solutions
- **Organization-Specific**: Organization-specific solutions

## Architecture Capability Framework

### Capability Overview
The Architecture Capability Framework provides guidelines for establishing and operating an architecture practice.

### Capability Components
- **Architecture Board**: Governance body for architecture decisions
- **Architecture Organization**: Structure and roles for architecture practice
- **Architecture Skills Framework**: Skills and competencies required
- **Architecture Tools**: Tools and repositories for architecture work

### Capability Maturity
- **Level 0**: None
