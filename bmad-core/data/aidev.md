# AIDEV Comments Quick Reference

This document provides a concise reference for standardized AIDEV comment tags to be used in AI-assisted codebases. Use these tags to ensure clarity, traceability, and effective collaboration between human developers and AI systems.

## Table of AIDEV Comment Tags

| Tag                | Description                                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AIDEV-GENERATED    | Marks code generated by an AI tool (e.g., Copilot, Claude, GPT). Optionally include tool/date. |
| AIDEV-ENHANCEMENT  | Indicates code enhanced or refactored with AI assistance.                                   |
| AIDEV-PROMPT       | Documents the prompt or instruction given to the AI for code generation.                    |
| AIDEV-NOTE         | Provides additional context, rationale, or implementation notes for AI-generated code.      |
| AIDEV-TEST         | Annotates AI-suggested test scenarios (actual test code should be human-authored).          |
| AIDEV-ANCHOR       | Highlights critical code sections or boundaries requiring special attention.                |
| AIDEV-QUESTION     | Marks areas where human input or decision is required.                                      |
| AIDEV-ANSWER       | Documents the human response to an AIDEV-QUESTION.                                         |
| AIDEV-TODO         | Indicates known improvements or follow-up actions for AI-generated code.                   |
| AIDEV-AUTO-UPDATE  | Marks documentation or code automatically maintained by AI tools.                          |

## Usage Examples

```java
// AIDEV-GENERATED: Claude 3.5 (2025-01-28)
// PROMPT: "Implement Redis caching layer with connection pooling"
// HUMAN-MODIFIED: Added error handling and metrics
public RedisClient createRedisClient() {
    // ... implementation ...
}

// AIDEV-ENHANCEMENT: Refactored for performance based on AI suggestion
// Original: N+1 query pattern, AI: Batched with JOIN

// AIDEV-PROMPT: "Create a REST endpoint for device management"

// AIDEV-NOTE: Rate limiting added per security policy

// AIDEV-TEST: AI-suggested scenario - rate limiting returns 429

// AIDEV-ANCHOR: Critical business logic - do not modify without review

// AIDEV-QUESTION: Should we log successful authentications?
// AIDEV-ANSWER: Yes, for audit compliance (updated 2025-01-15)

// AIDEV-TODO: Add support for multi-region deployment

// AIDEV-AUTO-UPDATE: Documentation maintained by AI, last updated 2025-01-28
```

## Best Practices
- Always use these tags as prefixes in comments (e.g., `// AIDEV-GENERATED: ...`).
- Combine tags as needed for clarity (e.g., `AIDEV-GENERATED` + `AIDEV-NOTE`).
- For more details and rationale, see [AI Code Comments Best Practices Guide](https://PAM.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RND/pages/5794726679/AI+Generated+Code+-+Best+Practice).
