# Zachman Framework

## Purpose
Comprehensive guide to the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture, providing a structured approach to organizing and classifying enterprise architecture artifacts and perspectives.

## Zachman Framework Overview

### What is the Zachman Framework?
The Zachman Framework is a classification scheme for organizing and analyzing enterprise architecture artifacts. It provides a structured way to view an enterprise from different perspectives and at different levels of abstraction.

## Framework Matrix

### Complete 36-Cell Matrix
The Zachman Framework creates a 36-cell matrix (6 perspectives Ã— 6 abstractions) where each cell represents a specific architectural artifact:

| Perspective/Abstraction | What (Data) | How (Function) | Where (Network) | Who (People) | When (Time) | Why (Motivation) |
|-------------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Planner** | Business Context | Business Strategy | Business Scope | Business Goals | Business Environment | Business Objectives |
| **Owner** | Business Information Model | Business Process Model | Business Location Model | Business Organization Model | Business Timing Model | Business Motivation Model |
| **Designer** | System Data Model | System Process Model | System Distribution Model | System Organization Model | System Timing Model | System Motivation Model |
| **Builder** | Technology Data Model | Technology Process Model | Technology Distribution Model | Technology Organization Model | Technology Timing Model | Technology Motivation Model |
| **Implementer** | Implementation Data Specs | Implementation Process Specs | Implementation Distribution Specs | Implementation Organization Specs | Implementation Timing Specs | Implementation Motivation Specs |
| **Worker** | Operational Data | Operational Processes | Operational Distribution | Operational Organization | Operational Timing | Operational Motivation |

## Framework Implementation
