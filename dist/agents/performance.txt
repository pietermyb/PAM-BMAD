# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

# conduct-performance-test

## Purpose
This task outlines the systematic steps for conducting a performance test. The primary goal is to simulate realistic user loads and interactions to evaluate the application's responsiveness, stability, and resource utilization under various conditions, ultimately identifying performance bottlenecks and validating system scalability.

## Workflow

### 1. Prepare Test Environment
Before initiating any performance test, it is crucial to set up and configure a dedicated test environment that closely mirrors the production environment. This ensures that test results are accurate and representative.

- **Environment Isolation and Configuration**: Ensure the test environment is isolated from other development or production activities to prevent interference. Configure all components (servers, databases, network) according to the specifications outlined in the performance test plan.
- **Application Deployment**: Deploy the application under test to the prepared environment. Verify that the application is fully functional and stable before proceeding with performance testing.
- **Test Data Preparation**: Prepare a sufficient volume and variety of realistic test data as specified in the performance test plan. This data should accurately represent production data characteristics to ensure meaningful test results.
- **Monitoring Tool Configuration**: Configure all necessary monitoring tools (e.g., APM, infrastructure monitoring, database monitoring) to collect relevant performance metrics from the application and underlying infrastructure during the test execution.

### 2. Configure Test Tool
This phase involves setting up the chosen performance testing tool with the prepared test scripts and workload models.

- **Load Test Script Loading**: Load the pre-developed performance test scripts into the selected performance testing tool (e.g., JMeter, LoadRunner, k6, Gatling). These scripts simulate user actions and interactions with the application.
- **Workload Model Configuration**: Configure the workload model within the test tool according to the performance test plan. This includes defining the number of virtual users, the ramp-up period (how quickly users are added), and the total duration of the test run.
- **Assertions and Error Handling**: Set up assertions within the test scripts to validate expected responses from the application. Implement robust error handling mechanisms to capture and log any failures or unexpected behaviors during the test.

### 3. Execute Test
This is the active phase where the performance test is run, simulating the defined workload against the application.

- **Start Monitoring**: Before initiating the test, ensure that all configured monitoring tools are actively collecting data from the test environment.
- **Initiate Test Run**: Start the performance test run from the configured test tool. The tool will begin generating the simulated load as per the workload model.
- **Monitor Execution**: Continuously monitor the test execution for any immediate issues, errors, or unexpected system behavior. This allows for early detection of critical problems that might require stopping and reconfiguring the test.
- **Ensure Planned Duration**: Verify that the test runs for its entire planned duration, allowing for the collection of sufficient data to analyze long-term performance trends and stability.

### 4. Collect Data
During and after the test execution, all relevant performance data must be systematically collected for subsequent analysis.

- **Performance Metrics Collection**: Gather performance metrics from all configured monitoring tools. This includes application response times, throughput (transactions/requests per second), and resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network) from all layers of the application stack.
- **Log Collection**: Collect application logs, server logs, and database logs generated during the test run. These logs are crucial for identifying errors, warnings, and understanding application behavior under load.
- **Error Reports and Exceptions**: Collect any specific error reports, exception logs, or failure details generated by the performance testing tool or the application itself.

### 5. Post-Execution Checks
After the test run is complete, a series of checks are performed to ensure data integrity and prepare for analysis.

- **Data Verification**: Verify that all expected performance data, logs, and error reports have been successfully collected and are complete.
- **Anomaly Check**: Perform an initial review of the collected data for any obvious anomalies, spikes, or unexpected patterns that might indicate issues during the test run itself.
- **Environment Reset**: If necessary, reset the test environment to its baseline state. This ensures that subsequent test runs start from a clean and consistent configuration.

## Outputs
- Raw performance test results and metrics.
- Application and infrastructure logs from the test period.
- Error reports and exception details.
- Initial observations and anomalies from the test run.

## Success Criteria
- Performance test executed successfully without tool or environment failures.
- All required performance metrics and logs are collected.
- Test duration completed as planned.
- Data collected is sufficient and valid for analysis.

## Dependencies
- A fully prepared and isolated test environment.
- Valid and functional performance test scripts.
- Configured monitoring tools.
- A defined performance test plan.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Test environment not accurately reflecting production.
  - **Mitigation**: Invest in dedicated, scaled test environments; use environment provisioning tools (IaC) to ensure consistency.
- **Risk**: Insufficient or unrealistic test data.
  - **Mitigation**: Plan test data generation carefully, use data masking for sensitive information, and ensure data volume is adequate.
- **Risk**: Performance test tool misconfiguration or script errors.
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct dry runs with minimal load, use version control for scripts, and perform peer reviews of test configurations.
- **Risk**: Monitoring tools failing to capture critical data.
  - **Mitigation**: Verify monitoring setup before tests, regularly check monitoring agent health, and cross-reference data from multiple sources.
- **Risk**: Interference from other activities in the test environment.
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure strict isolation of the test environment and schedule tests during off-peak hours if shared resources are unavoidable.

# analyze-performance-bottlenecks

## Purpose
This task provides a systematic approach for analyzing performance test results to identify, understand, and document performance bottlenecks within an application and its underlying infrastructure. The primary goal is to transform raw performance data into actionable insights that can guide optimization efforts and improve overall system performance.

## Workflow

### 1. Review Performance Test Report
The first step involves a comprehensive review of the performance test report to establish context and understand the scope of the analysis.

- **Executive Summary Analysis**: Start by thoroughly reviewing the executive summary and key findings of the performance test report. This provides a high-level overview of the test outcomes and highlights the most critical areas of concern.
- **Test Context Understanding**: Understand the test objectives, scenarios executed, workload models used, and the test environment configuration. This context is crucial for interpreting the results accurately.
- **Baseline Comparison**: If available, compare the current test results with previous baseline performance metrics or established performance targets to identify deviations and trends.

### 2. Analyze Key Performance Metrics
This phase involves a detailed examination of core performance indicators to identify areas where the system is underperforming.

- **Response Time Analysis**: Examine response times for critical transactions and user journeys. Look for high averages, unusual spikes, percentile distributions (50th, 90th, 95th, 99th), and deviations from expected behavioral patterns. Pay special attention to transactions that exceed acceptable response time thresholds.
- **Throughput Assessment**: Analyze transactions per second (TPS) or requests per second (RPS) metrics. Determine if the system is meeting established throughput targets and identify any degradation patterns as load increases.
- **Error Rate Evaluation**: Systematically check for errors, timeouts, and failed transactions during the test. High error rates often indicate underlying bottlenecks or system instability. Categorize errors by type and frequency to understand their impact.
- **Resource Utilization Review**: Comprehensively review CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network utilization metrics across all tiers of the application stack, including application servers, database servers, load balancers, and other infrastructure components. Identify resources that are consistently high (>80%) or maxed out (>95%).

### 3. Correlate Performance Data
This critical step involves connecting different data points to understand the relationships between performance symptoms and their underlying causes.

- **Temporal Correlation**: Correlate spikes in response times with corresponding increases in resource utilization, error rates, or other performance indicators. Use precise timestamps to align events and identify causal relationships.
- **Cross-System Alignment**: Use timestamps to align events across different monitoring systems, including application logs, server logs, database logs, and infrastructure monitoring tools. This holistic view helps identify system-wide patterns and dependencies.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Look for recurring patterns, such as periodic performance degradation, which might indicate background processes, garbage collection cycles, or scheduled tasks impacting performance.

### 4. Deep Dive into System Components
This phase requires detailed analysis of each layer of the application stack to pinpoint specific bottlenecks and their root causes.

- **Application Layer Analysis**:
  - Analyze application logs for exceptions, long-running processes, memory leaks, or frequent garbage collection events that could impact performance.
  - Use Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools to trace individual requests and identify slow code paths, inefficient algorithms, N+1 query problems, or excessive object creation.
  - Review thread dumps or heap dumps if memory management or threading issues are suspected.
  - Examine application-specific metrics such as connection pool utilization, cache hit ratios, and queue depths.

- **Database Layer Investigation**:
  - Examine database performance metrics including slow query logs, lock contention, deadlocks, buffer cache hit ratios, I/O wait times, and connection pool utilization.
  - Analyze query execution plans for inefficient queries, missing indexes, table scans, or suboptimal join strategies.
  - Review database server resource utilization and identify potential storage or memory constraints.
  - Check for database-specific issues such as index fragmentation, statistics outdated, or transaction log growth.

- **Network Layer Assessment**:
  - Measure network latency, packet loss, bandwidth utilization, and connection establishment times between different system components.
  - Investigate potential issues with load balancers, firewalls, or network routing that could impact performance.
  - Analyze SSL/TLS handshake times and connection pooling efficiency for encrypted communications.

- **Infrastructure Layer Examination**:
  - Review hypervisor or cloud provider metrics for underlying virtual machine or container performance, including CPU steal time, memory ballooning, or resource contention.
  - Analyze disk I/O latency, throughput, and queue depths for storage subsystems.
  - Examine containerization metrics such as container resource limits, orchestration overhead, and inter-service communication patterns.

### 5. Identify and Categorize Root Causes
This step transforms the technical analysis into clear understanding of performance bottlenecks and their underlying causes.

- **Bottleneck Identification**: Based on the comprehensive analysis, pinpoint the specific components, code segments, or infrastructure elements causing performance bottlenecks.
- **Root Cause Hypothesis**: Formulate clear hypotheses about the root causes of each identified bottleneck. Examples include inefficient database queries, unoptimized algorithms, insufficient infrastructure resources, memory leaks, or architectural limitations.
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate the impact of each bottleneck on overall system performance, user experience, and business objectives.
- **Bottleneck Classification**: Categorize bottlenecks by type (CPU-bound, I/O-bound, memory-bound, network-bound) and criticality (high, medium, low) to guide prioritization efforts.

### 6. Document Findings and Recommendations
The final step involves creating comprehensive documentation that will guide subsequent optimization efforts.

- **Detailed Documentation**: Create thorough documentation of all identified bottlenecks, including their symptoms, root causes, impact assessment, and supporting evidence from the analysis.
- **Priority Ranking**: Prioritize bottlenecks based on their impact on overall system performance, ease of resolution, and alignment with business objectives. Use a structured approach such as impact vs. effort matrix.

# optimize-code

## Purpose
This task outlines the systematic process for optimizing code based on findings from performance analysis. The primary goal is to improve application performance, reduce resource consumption, and enhance scalability by identifying and addressing inefficiencies within the codebase.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand Performance Bottlenecks
Before any optimization can begin, a thorough understanding of the identified performance bottlenecks is essential. This involves reviewing the performance analysis report and pinpointing the exact areas of concern.

- **Review Performance Analysis Report**: Carefully examine the performance analysis report to grasp the nature and impact of the identified bottlenecks. This report should provide data-driven insights into where the system is underperforming.
- **Pinpoint Code Sections**: Identify the specific code sections, functions, modules, or components that are contributing to the performance issues. This requires drilling down from high-level metrics to granular code segments.
- **Understand Root Cause**: Determine the underlying root cause of each bottleneck. This could be due to inefficient algorithms, excessive database calls, high memory consumption, I/O bound operations, or other architectural or implementation flaws.

### 2. Prioritize Optimizations
With a clear understanding of the bottlenecks, the next step is to prioritize optimization efforts to maximize impact with reasonable effort.

- **Impact vs. Effort Analysis**: Prioritize optimization efforts based on a balance between the potential performance impact of resolving a bottleneck and the estimated effort required to implement the fix. Focus on changes that will yield the most significant performance gains.

### 3. Implement Code Optimizations
This phase involves making targeted changes to the codebase to address the identified inefficiencies. The approach will vary depending on the nature of the bottleneck.

- **Algorithm Optimization**: Replace inefficient algorithms with more performant ones. For example, converting an O(n^2) algorithm to an O(n log n) or O(n) algorithm can dramatically improve performance for large datasets.
- **Data Structure Optimization**: Choose and implement appropriate data structures for the task at hand. Using a HashMap for fast lookups instead of an ArrayList for frequent searches, or a LinkedList for frequent insertions/deletions, can significantly impact performance.
- **Reduce I/O Operations**: Minimize unnecessary disk reads/writes or network calls. Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., in-memory cache, distributed cache) where appropriate to reduce the frequency of expensive I/O operations.
- **Database Query Optimization**:
  - **Rewrite Inefficient SQL Queries**: Analyze and rewrite SQL queries that are performing poorly. This might involve optimizing `JOIN` clauses, `WHERE` conditions, or subqueries.
  - **Add or Optimize Database Indexes**: Create new indexes or optimize existing ones to speed up data retrieval for frequently accessed columns or those used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, or `ORDER BY` clauses.
  - **Reduce Database Round Trips**: Minimize the number of interactions with the database. Use batch operations for multiple inserts/updates, or employ eager loading to fetch related data in a single query instead of multiple individual queries.
- **Memory Management**:
  - **Reduce Object Creation**: Optimize code to reduce the creation of unnecessary objects, thereby minimizing garbage collection overhead and improving application responsiveness.
  - **Optimize Data Storage**: Design data structures and storage mechanisms to reduce the memory footprint of the application, especially for large datasets.
- **Concurrency and Parallelism**:
  - **Utilize Multi-threading/Asynchronous Programming**: For CPU-bound tasks, leverage multi-threading, parallel processing, or asynchronous programming models to utilize available CPU cores more effectively and improve responsiveness.
  - **Ensure Proper Synchronization**: Implement appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, semaphores) to avoid contention and ensure data consistency in concurrent environments.
- **Code Refactoring**:
  - **Remove Redundant Code**: Eliminate duplicate code or unnecessary computations that add overhead without providing value.
  - **Optimize Loops and Conditionals**: Refactor loops and conditional statements for better performance, such as moving invariant computations outside loops or optimizing branching logic.
- **Third-Party Library Usage**: Ensure that external libraries and frameworks are used efficiently and correctly. Misuse or inefficient configuration of libraries can introduce performance overhead.

### 4. Test Optimizations
After implementing code optimizations, rigorous testing is crucial to validate the improvements and ensure no new issues have been introduced.

- **Unit Testing**: Ensure that all existing unit tests pass for the modified code. Add new unit tests specifically for the optimized sections to cover new logic or edge cases.
- **Performance Testing**: Rerun performance tests using the same scenarios and workload models as the initial analysis. This is critical to validate that the optimizations have indeed led to the expected performance improvements and that no regressions have occurred.
- **Regression Testing**: Conduct comprehensive regression tests to ensure that the code optimizations have not inadvertently introduced new bugs or broken existing functionalities elsewhere in the application.

### 5. Document Changes
Documenting the implemented optimizations is vital for knowledge sharing, future maintenance, and understanding the rationale behind performance improvements.

- **Document Optimizations**: Clearly document the changes made, the rationale behind each optimization, and the observed performance improvements (e.g., reduced response time, lower CPU usage).
- **Update Design Documents**: Update any relevant design documents, architectural diagrams, or technical specifications to reflect the changes introduced by the code optimizations.

## Outputs
- Optimized codebase with improved performance characteristics.
- Performance test results validating the improvements.
- Updated documentation reflecting code changes and performance gains.

## Success Criteria

- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O) is reduced for the optimized code sections.
- No new bugs or regressions are introduced by the optimizations.
- The optimized code adheres to coding standards and best practices.
- Performance improvements are validated through re-testing.

## Dependencies
- Detailed performance analysis report with identified bottlenecks.
- Access to the codebase and development environment.
- Performance testing tools and environment.
- Collaboration with QA and operations teams.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Optimizations introducing new bugs or regressions.
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough unit, performance, and regression testing; phased rollouts; and robust monitoring in production.
- **Risk**: Over-optimization of non-critical code sections.
  - **Mitigation**: Prioritize optimizations based on impact and effort; focus on identified bottlenecks rather than speculative changes.
- **Risk**: Performance improvements not meeting expectations.
  - **Mitigation**: Re-evaluate root cause analysis; consider alternative optimization strategies; involve performance experts.
- **Risk**: Increased code complexity due to optimizations.
  - **Mitigation**: Balance performance gains with code readability and maintainability; document complex optimizations thoroughly.
- **Risk**: Inaccurate performance testing leading to false positives/negatives.
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure realistic workload modeling, accurate test data, and proper test environment configuration.

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-core/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-core/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**
   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:
   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:
   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:
   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:
   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:
   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification
