# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

# manage-infrastructure

## Purpose
This task outlines the systematic approach to managing infrastructure, primarily leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to ensure consistency, repeatability, and scalability. It covers the entire lifecycle from understanding requirements to deployment and verification.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand Requirements
Before any infrastructure changes are initiated, a clear understanding of the desired state and existing landscape is crucial. This phase focuses on gathering and clarifying all relevant information.

- **Clarify Changes**: Precisely define the infrastructure changes or new resources that are needed. This includes understanding the functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security, availability).
- **Identify Target Environment**: Determine the specific environment(s) where the infrastructure changes will be applied (e.g., development, staging, production). Each environment may have unique considerations.
- **Review Existing IaC and Documentation**: Examine current Infrastructure as Code definitions, existing infrastructure, and any related documentation to understand the baseline and identify potential impacts or dependencies.

### 2. Plan Infrastructure Changes
Once requirements are understood, a detailed plan is developed to guide the infrastructure modifications. This ensures a well-thought-out approach that considers various aspects of the infrastructure.

- **Design Architecture**: For new infrastructure, design the architecture, including component interactions, network topology, and security considerations. For modifications, assess how changes fit into the existing architecture.
- **Select IaC Tool and Modules**: Choose the most appropriate Infrastructure as Code tool (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible) and relevant modules or templates that align with the planned changes and organizational standards.
- **Define Resource Configurations**: Specify the detailed configurations for all resources, such as compute instances (VMs, containers), storage (databases, object storage), and networking components (VPCs, subnets, load balancers).
- **Consider Implications**: Evaluate the security, cost, and compliance implications of the proposed infrastructure changes. Ensure adherence to organizational policies and regulatory requirements.

### 3. Develop/Update IaC
This phase involves the actual coding of the infrastructure, translating the plan into executable IaC scripts.

- **Write/Modify IaC Code**: Develop new IaC code or update existing code to reflect the planned infrastructure changes. This includes defining resources, their properties, and relationships.
- **Follow Best Practices**: Adhere to established coding standards and best practices for Infrastructure as Code, such as modularity, reusability, and clear naming conventions.
- **Parameterize Configurations**: Design IaC to be parameterized, allowing for easy adaptation to different environments without modifying the core code. This promotes reusability and reduces errors.
- **Implement Secrets Management**: Integrate with a secure secrets management solution to handle sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials) within the IaC, preventing hardcoding of secrets.

### 4. Validate IaC
Before deployment, the IaC code must be thoroughly validated to catch errors early and ensure the intended outcome.

- **Run Static Analysis**: Execute static analysis tools (e.g., `terraform validate`, `cfn-lint`) to check for syntax errors, best practice violations, and potential issues in the IaC code.
- **Perform Dry Runs/Plan Executions**: Conduct dry runs or plan executions (e.g., `terraform plan`) to preview the changes that will be applied to the infrastructure without actually making them. This provides a clear understanding of the impact.
- **Review with Stakeholders**: Review the planned changes and the output of dry runs with relevant stakeholders, including security, architecture, and operations teams, to ensure alignment and address concerns.

### 5. Deploy Infrastructure
This is the execution phase where the validated IaC is applied to provision or update the infrastructure in the target environment.

- **Execute IaC**: Run the IaC scripts to provision new resources or modify existing ones in the designated environment. This should ideally be part of an automated CI/CD pipeline.
- **Monitor Deployment**: Continuously monitor the deployment process for any errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior. Automated alerts should be configured for critical failures.
- **Verify Resource Creation**: After the deployment, verify that all resources have been created or updated successfully and are in the expected state.

### 6. Post-Deployment Verification
After successful deployment, a series of checks are performed to ensure the infrastructure is functioning correctly and as intended.

- **Connectivity Tests**: Perform connectivity tests to new or modified resources to ensure they are reachable and can communicate with other components.
- **Validate Configurations**: Verify that resource configurations and settings are applied correctly and match the IaC definitions.
- **Monitoring and Logging Activation**: Confirm that monitoring and logging solutions are active and collecting data for the newly deployed or updated infrastructure components.
- **Update Documentation**: Update any relevant infrastructure documentation, diagrams, or runbooks to reflect the changes.

### 7. Rollback Preparedness
A robust rollback strategy is essential to mitigate risks in case of unforeseen issues post-deployment.

- **Define Rollback Strategy**: Ensure a clear and well-defined rollback strategy is in place and understood by the team. This includes identifying the conditions that trigger a rollback.
- **Document Reversion Steps**: Document the precise steps required to revert the infrastructure changes if a rollback becomes necessary. This should be part of the deployment plan.

## Outputs
